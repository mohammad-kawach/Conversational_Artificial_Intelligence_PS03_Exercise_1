        "since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold\n",
        "winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so\n",
        "penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly\n",
        "afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with\n",
        "nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,\n",
        "the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to\n",

        "\n",
        "The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama\n",

        "her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)\n",
        "looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;\n",
        "saying, \"She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a\n",
        "distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her\n",
        "own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a\n",
        "more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly\n",
        "manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really\n",

        "\"What does Bessie say I have done?\" I asked.\n",
        "\n",

        "seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It\n",
        "contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care\n",
        "that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-\n",
        "seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having\n",
        "drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double\n",
        "retirement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left\n",
        "were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the\n",
        "drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my\n",
        "book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a\n",
        "pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat\n",
        "shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and\n",
        "lamentable blast.\n",
        "\n",
        "I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress\n",
        "thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were\n",
        "certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite\n",
        "as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of\n",
        "\"the solitary rocks and promontories\" by them only inhabited; of the\n",
        "coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the\n",
        "Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--\n",
        "\n",
        "   \"Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\n",
        "   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles\n",
        "   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\n",
        "   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,\n",
        "Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with \"the vast\n",
        "sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that\n",
        "reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation\n",
        "of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround\n",
        "the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.\"  Of\n",
        "these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all\n",
        "the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,\n",
        "but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages\n",
        "connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance\n",
        "to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken\n",
        "boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing\n",
        "through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with\n",
        "its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,\n",
        "girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the\n",
        "hour of eventide.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over\n",
        "quickly: it was an object of terror.\n",
        "\n",
        "So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant\n",
        "crowd surrounding a gallows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped\n",
        "understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as\n",
        "interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,\n",
        "when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her\n",
        "ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and\n",
        "while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap\n",
        "borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure\n",

        "him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which\n",
        "had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran\n",
        "from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had\n",
        "indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles\n",
        "could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I\n",

        "perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a\n",

        "the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most\n",
        "opaque sky, \"onding on snaw,\" canopied all; thence flakes felt it\n",
        "intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without\n",
        "melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and\n",

        "It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step\n",
        "came tripping down the path.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You naughty little thing!\" she said.  \"Why don't you come when you are\n",

        "\n",
        "Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been\n",

        "The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not\n",
        "disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_\n",
        "disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two\n",

        "\n",
        "The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to\n",
        "indulge in: somehow it pleased her.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You are a strange child, Miss Jane,\" she said, as she looked down at me;\n",
        "\"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I\n",

        "\n",
        "\"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should\n",

        "\"What! to get more knocks?\"\n",
        "\n",

        "afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a\n",
        "little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I\n",

        "you'd _rather_ not.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie\n",
        "told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her\n",

        "\n",
        "Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,\n",
        "when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and\n",
        "nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had\n",
        "washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just\n",
        "setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I\n",
        "was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates\n",
        "at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in\n",
        "the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children\n",
        "can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,\n",
        "having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and\n",
        "bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and\n",
        "put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,\n",
        "and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we\n",
        "passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, \"Will you go in and bid Missis good-\n",
        "bye?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to\n",
        "supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins\n",
        "either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best\n",
        "friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What did you say, Miss?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to\n",
        "the wall.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That was wrong, Miss Jane.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has\n",
        "been my foe.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"O Miss Jane! don't say so!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Good-bye to Gateshead!\" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went\n",
        "out at the front door.\n",
        "\n",
        "The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose\n",
        "light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw\n",
        "and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down\n",
        "the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,\n",
        "we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had\n",
        "been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It\n",
        "wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,\n",
        "the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door\n",
        "and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is she going by herself?\" asked the porter's wife.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And how far is it?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fifty miles.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far\n",
        "alone.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its\n",
        "top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my\n",
        "trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung\n",
        "with kisses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Be sure and take good care of her,\" cried she to the guard, as he lifted\n",
        "me into the inside.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ay, ay!\" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed \"All\n",
        "right,\" and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;\n",
        "thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and\n",
        "mysterious regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to\n",
        "me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over\n",
        "hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,\n",
        "a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the\n",
        "passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard\n",
        "wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in\n",
        "an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from\n",
        "the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled\n",
        "with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling\n",
        "very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and\n",
        "kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having\n",
        "frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard\n",
        "returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted\n",
        "his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the\n",
        "\"stony street\" of L-.\n",
        "\n",
        "The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I\n",
        "began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we\n",
        "ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills\n",
        "heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,\n",
        "dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I\n",
        "heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered\n",
        "when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,\n",
        "and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress\n",
        "by the light of the lamps.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?\" she asked.  I answered\n",
        "\"Yes,\" and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach\n",
        "instantly drove away.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion\n",
        "of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and\n",
        "darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me\n",
        "and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she\n",
        "shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or\n",
        "houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights\n",
        "burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were\n",
        "admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room\n",
        "with a fire, where she left me alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;\n",
        "there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by\n",
        "intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:\n",
        "it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at\n",
        "Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the\n",
        "subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual\n",
        "carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large\n",
        "forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was\n",
        "grave, her bearing erect.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The child is very young to be sent alone,\" said she, putting her candle\n",
        "down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,\n",
        "then further added--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?\" she\n",
        "asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A little, ma'am.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to\n",
        "bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to\n",
        "come to school, my little girl?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had\n",
        "been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,\n",
        "write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her\n",
        "forefinger, and saying, \"She hoped I should be a good child,\" dismissed\n",
        "me along with Miss Miller.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me\n",
        "appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,\n",
        "and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a\n",
        "careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always\n",
        "a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards\n",
        "found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from\n",
        "compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and\n",
        "irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary\n",
        "silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came\n",
        "upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,\n",
        "with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of\n",
        "candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of\n",
        "every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the\n",
        "dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality\n",
        "exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of\n",
        "quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;\n",
        "they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I\n",
        "had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up\n",
        "to the top of the long room she cried out--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered\n",
        "the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with\n",
        "portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher\n",
        "of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed\n",
        "round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common\n",
        "to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not\n",
        "touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:\n",
        "I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed\n",
        "off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I\n",
        "scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like\n",
        "the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss\n",
        "Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced\n",
        "at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two\n",
        "occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst\n",
        "silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\n",
        "\n",
        "The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once\n",
        "awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in\n",
        "torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my\n",
        "side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls\n",
        "were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or\n",
        "two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and\n",
        "I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a\n",
        "basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to\n",
        "six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell\n",
        "rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the\n",
        "stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were\n",
        "read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Form classes!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller\n",
        "repeatedly exclaimed, \"Silence!\" and \"Order!\"  When it subsided, I saw\n",
        "them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the\n",
        "four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a\n",
        "Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some\n",
        "seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss\n",
        "Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each\n",
        "walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth\n",
        "vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the\n",
        "smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was\n",
        "called, and placed at the bottom of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of\n",
        "Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of\n",
        "chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise\n",
        "was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded\n",
        "for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another\n",
        "room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting\n",
        "something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so\n",
        "little the day before.\n",
        "\n",
        "The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables\n",
        "smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth\n",
        "an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of\n",
        "discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those\n",
        "destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of\n",
        "the first class, rose the whispered words--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Silence!\" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the\n",
        "upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of\n",
        "somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,\n",
        "while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her\n",

        "dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,\n",
        "with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's\n",
        "purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose\n",
        "of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made\n",
        "shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this\n",

        "an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the\n",

        "money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little\n",

        "to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready\n",
        "with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would\n",

        "and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past\n",
        "fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no\n",

        "lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;\n",
        "it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by\n",
        "encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief\n",
        "address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious\n",
        "instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of\n",
        "the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations\n",
        "of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their\n",
        "cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread\n",
        "alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His\n",

        "gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,\n",
        "appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;\n",
        "especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's\n",
        "chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified\n",
        "severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls\n",
        "to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and\n",
        "again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,\n",
        "plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will\n",
        "send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the\n",
        "excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first\n",
        "form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away\n",
        "the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and\n",
        "when the first class could take in what was required of them, they\n",
        "obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and\n",
        "grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.\n",
        "Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,\n",
        "whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside\n",

        "sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young\n",
        "persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity\n",

        "and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and\n",
        "seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich\n",
        "plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a\n",
        "profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was\n",
        "enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a\n",
        "false front of French curls.\n",
        "\n",
        "These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the\n",
        "Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the\n",
        "room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend\n",
        "relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room\n",
        "upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned\n",
        "the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to\n",
        "address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with\n",
        "the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no\n",

        "personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude\n",
        "observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while\n",
        "seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to\n",
        "conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous\n",

        "forget I have a word to say respecting her.\"  Then aloud: how loud it\n",
        "seemed to me!  \"Let the child who broke her slate come forward!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two\n",
        "great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me\n",
        "towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his\n",

        "\n",
        "A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel\n",
        "that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,\n",
        "must be firmly sustained.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"My dear children,\" pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,\n",

        "castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and\n",
        "an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her\n",
        "example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,\n",
        "and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep\n",
        "your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,\n",
        "punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,\n",

        "\n",
        "Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect\n",

        "\n",
        "\"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady\n",

        "whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an\n",
        "ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was\n",
        "obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious\n",

        "Turning at the door, my judge said--\n",

        "exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were\n",
        "no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath\n",
        "and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she\n",

        "extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling\n",
        "bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,\n",
        "and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,\n",
        "lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked\n",
        "some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the\n",
        "triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she\n",
        "again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was\n",
        "the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked\n",
        "lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from\n",
        "the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm\n",

        "Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and\n",
        "all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it\n",
        "was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The\n",
        "spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction\n",
        "took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I\n",
        "sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was\n",
        "not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my\n",
        "tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much\n",
        "at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.\n",
        "Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the\n",
        "head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had\n",
        "smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me\n",
        "learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months\n",
        "longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an\n",
        "equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay\n",
        "again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Never,\" I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this\n",
        "wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen\n",
        "Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,\n",
        "vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Come, eat something,\" she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as\n",
        "if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen\n",
        "regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,\n",
        "though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the\n",
        "ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head\n",
        "upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the\n",
        "first who spoke--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a\n",
        "liar?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you\n",
        "called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises\n",
        "or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:\n",
        "he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had\n",
        "he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,\n",
        "declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would\n",
        "offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on\n",
        "you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their\n",
        "hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long\n",
        "appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.\n",
        "Besides, Jane\"--she paused.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well, Helen?\" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers\n",
        "gently to warm them, and went on--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own\n",

        "\n",
        "\"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if\n",
        "others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be\n",
        "solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from\n",
        "you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly\n",
        "submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to\n",
        "stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too\n",
        "impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and\n",
        "put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble\n",
        "self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides\n",
        "the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:\n",
        "that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,\n",
        "for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and\n",
        "shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see\n",
        "our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you\n",
        "are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously\n",
        "repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in\n",
        "your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the\n",
        "separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,\n",
        "then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon\n",
        "over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted\n",
        "there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of\n",
        "woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having\n",
        "done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I\n",
        "momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she\n",
        "drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,\n",
        "when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a\n",
        "rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through\n",
        "a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which\n",
        "we at once recognised as Miss Temple.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,\" said she; \"I want you in my\n",
        "room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some\n",
        "intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her\n",
        "apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple\n",
        "told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the\n",
        "hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is it all over?\" she asked, looking down at my face.  \"Have you cried\n",
        "your grief away?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I am afraid I never shall do that.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Why?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,\n",
        "will now think me wicked.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to\n",
        "act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Shall I, Miss Temple?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You will,\" said she, passing her arm round me.  \"And now tell me who is\n",
        "the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her\n",
        "care.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often\n",
        "heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would\n",
        "always keep me.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a\n",
        "criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.\n",
        "You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as\n",
        "you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and\n",
        "exaggerate nothing.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most\n",
        "correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange\n",
        "coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad\n",
        "childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it\n",
        "generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's\n",
        "warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the\n",
        "narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained\n",
        "and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss\n",
        "Temple fully believed me.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see\n",
        "me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the\n",
        "red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to\n",
        "break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of\n",
        "agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication\n",
        "for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she\n",
        "then said--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees\n",
        "with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;\n",
        "to me, Jane, you are clear now.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well\n",
        "contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the\n",
        "contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white\n",
        "forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she\n",
        "proceeded to address Helen Burns.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And the pain in your chest?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It is a little better.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she\n",
        "returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She\n",
        "was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.\"  She\n",
        "rang her bell.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Barbara,\" she said to the servant who answered it, \"I have not yet had\n",
        "tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups\n",
        "and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!\n",
        "How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!\n",
        "of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)\n",
        "discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Barbara,\" said she, \"can you not bring a little more bread and butter?\n",
        "There is not enough for three.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Barbara went out: she returned soon--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.\n",
        "Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Oh, very well!\" returned Miss Temple; \"we must make it do, Barbara, I\n",
        "suppose.\"  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, \"Fortunately, I\n",
        "have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each\n",
        "of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got\n",
        "up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,\n",
        "disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,\" said she,\n",
        "\"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,\" and she\n",
        "proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least\n",
        "delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which\n",
        "our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the\n",
        "delicate fare she liberally supplied.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat\n",
        "one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and\n",
        "Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her\n",
        "mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation\n",
        "into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the\n",
        "pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling\n",
        "sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was\n",
        "struck with wonder.\n",
        "\n",
        "The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her\n",
        "beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her\n",
        "own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they\n",
        "kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till\n",
        "this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the\n",
        "liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more\n",
        "singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor\n",
        "long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of\n",
        "radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what\n",
        "source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,\n",
        "vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid\n",
        "eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to\n",
        "me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very\n",
        "brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.\n",
        "\n",
        "They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;\n",
        "of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:\n",
        "they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge\n",
        "they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and\n",
        "French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple\n",
        "asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her\n",
        "father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and\n",
        "construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration\n",
        "expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell\n",
        "announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us\n",
        "both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"God bless you, my children!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;\n",
        "it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second\n",
        "time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.\n",
        "\n",
        "On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was\n",
        "examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we\n",
        "entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow\n",
        "she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her\n",
        "shoulder.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"My things were indeed in shameful disorder,\" murmured Helen to me, in a\n",
        "low voice: \"I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece\n",
        "of pasteboard the word \"Slattern,\" and bound it like a phylactery round\n",
        "Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore\n",
        "it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved\n",
        "punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I\n",
        "ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which\n",
        "she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and\n",
        "large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her\n",
        "sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.\n",
        "\n",
        "About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,\n",
        "who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what\n",
        "he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled\n",
        "the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges\n",
        "alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to\n",
        "pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers\n",
        "then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran\n",
        "through the ranks of my companions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,\n",
        "resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and\n",
        "my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally\n",
        "tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few\n",
        "weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was\n",
        "allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses\n",
        "of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-\n",
        "bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the\n",
        "same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in\n",
        "imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread\n",
        "and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I\n",
        "feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the\n",
        "dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,\n",
        "picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings\n",
        "of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe\n",
        "cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with\n",
        "young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my\n",
        "ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story\n",

        "glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon\n",

        "softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept\n",
        "from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was\n",

        "close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient\n",

        "\n",
        "Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,\n",

        "in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt\n",
        "dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards\n",
        "that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I\n",
        "advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Can it be you, Jane?\" she asked, in her own gentle voice.\n",

        "nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she\n",
        "whispered--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my\n",
        "quilt.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a\n",
        "long silence, she resumed, still whispering--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be\n",
        "sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die\n",
        "one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is\n",
        "gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me\n",
        "much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss\n",
        "me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not\n",
        "qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have\n",

        "\n",
        "\"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely\n",
        "implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the\n",
        "hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,\n",
        "reveal Him to me.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and\n",

        "mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  \"Where is that\n",

        "it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the\n",
        "number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry\n",
        "was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts\n",
        "came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The\n",
        "unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's\n",
        "food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'\n",

        "Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed\n",
        "largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better\n",
        "situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing\n",
        "introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a\n",

        "too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,\n",
        "comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus\n",
        "improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I\n",
        "remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:\n",
        "six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my\n",

        "\n",
        "During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it\n",

        "within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel\n",
        "in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially\n",
        "such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages\n",
        "offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then\n",

        "feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to\n",

        "reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon\n",
        "was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,\n",
        "namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that\n",
        "my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that\n",
        "she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her\n",
        "vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to\n",
        "feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were\n",
        "withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to\n",
        "be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no\n",
        "more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been\n",
        "of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,\n",
        "and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and\n",
        "excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,\n",
        "to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.\n",

        "I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings\n",

        "there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on\n",
        "those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all\n",
        "within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile\n",
        "limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,\n",
        "and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!\n",
        "I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I\n",
        "remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have\n",
        "elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never\n",
        "quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed\n",
        "had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had\n",
        "ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message\n",
        "with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and\n",
        "notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and\n",
        "preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now\n",
        "I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in\n",
        "one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I\n",
        "uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I\n",
        "abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:\n",
        "that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: \"Then,\" I cried,\n",

        "from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of\n",
        "small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,\n",

        "when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a\n",
        "room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on\n",

        "the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when\n",

        "\n",
        "\"I suppose,\" thought I, \"judging from the plainness of the servant and\n",

        "worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our\n",
        "road now, I wonder?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by\n",
        "the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,\n",
        "much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort\n",
        "of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt\n",
        "we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;\n",
        "more stirring, less romantic.\n",
        "\n",
        "The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk\n",
        "all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two\n",

        "\"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower\n",
        "against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow\n",
        "galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About\n",
        "ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we\n",
        "passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a\n",
        "drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from\n",
        "one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the\n",
        "front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Will you walk this way, ma'am?\" said the girl; and I followed her across\n",
        "a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose\n",
        "double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting\n",
        "as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours\n",
        "inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented\n",
        "itself to my view.\n",
        "\n",
        "A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-\n",
        "backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little\n",
        "elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;\n",
        "exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and\n",
        "milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely\n",
        "at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of\n",
        "domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess\n",
        "could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no\n",
        "stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and\n",
        "promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?\" said I.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, you are right: do sit down.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and\n",
        "untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with\n",

        "the keys of the storeroom.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and\n",
        "delivered them to the servant.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,\" she continued.  \"You've brought\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n",

        "\"I'll see it carried into your room,\" she said, and bustled out.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She treats me like a visitor,\" thought I.  \"I little expected such a\n",
        "reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like\n",

        "too soon.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a\n",
        "book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now\n",
        "brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather\n",
        "confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before\n",
        "received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she\n",
        "did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,\n",
        "I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?\" I asked,\n",

        "\n",
        "\"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf,\" returned the good lady,\n",
        "approaching her ear to my mouth.\n",

        "too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I am so glad,\" she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took\n",
        "the cat on her knee; \"I am so glad you are come; it will be quite\n",
        "pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at\n",
        "any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late\n",
        "years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in\n",
        "winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say\n",
        "alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very\n",
        "decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't\n",
        "converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due\n",
        "distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it\n",
        "was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it\n",
        "rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the\n",
        "house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy\n",
        "with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me\n",
        "sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt\n",
        "it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long\n",
        "days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this\n",
        "autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house\n",
        "alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew\n",
        "my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she\n",
        "might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night,\" said she; \"it is on the\n",
        "stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel\n",
        "tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your\n",
        "bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a\n",
        "small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the\n",
        "large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are\n",
        "so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued\n",
        "with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her\n",
        "candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the\n",
        "hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the\n",
        "way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window\n",
        "was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the\n",
        "bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a\n",
        "house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,\n",
        "suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when\n",
        "finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and\n",
        "furnished in ordinary, modern style.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my\n",
        "door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie\n",
        "impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and\n",
        "that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I\n",
        "remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was\n",
        "now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,\n",
        "and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were\n",
        "due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and\n",
        "the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me\n",
        "before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my\n",
        "solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and\n",
        "soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in\n",
        "between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a\n",
        "carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,\n",
        "that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the\n",
        "young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that\n",
        "was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.\n",
        "My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to\n",
        "hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,\n",
        "but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at\n",
        "an indefinite future period.\n",
        "\n",
        "I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no\n",
        "article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still\n",
        "by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful\n",
        "of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I\n",
        "ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want\n",
        "of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;\n",
        "I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry\n",
        "mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I\n",
        "felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so\n",
        "irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these\n",
        "regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say\n",
        "it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.\n",
        "However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black\n",
        "frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to\n",
        "a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do\n",
        "respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil\n",
        "would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my\n",
        "chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the\n",
        "toilet table, I ventured forth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of\n",
        "oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some\n",
        "pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a\n",
        "cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a\n",
        "bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of\n",
        "oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything\n",
        "appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little\n",
        "accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood\n",
        "open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the\n",
        "early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;\n",
        "advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the\n",
        "mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though\n",
        "considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:\n",
        "battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front\n",
        "stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants\n",
        "were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a\n",
        "great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where\n",
        "an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at\n",
        "once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off\n",
        "were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so\n",
        "like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and\n",
        "lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I\n",
        "had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of\n",
        "Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled\n",
        "up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood\n",
        "nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the\n",
        "house and gates.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet\n",
        "listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the\n",
        "wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for\n",
        "one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady\n",
        "appeared at the door.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What! out already?\" said she.  \"I see you are an early riser.\"  I went\n",
        "up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"How do you like Thornfield?\" she asked.  I told her I liked it very\n",
        "much.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes,\" she said, \"it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out\n",
        "of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and\n",
        "reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great\n",
        "houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Mr. Rochester!\" I exclaimed.  \"Who is he?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The owner of Thornfield,\" she responded quietly.  \"Did you not know he\n",
        "was called Rochester?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady\n",
        "seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with\n",
        "which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I thought,\" I continued, \"Thornfield belonged to you.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the\n",
        "housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the\n",
        "Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a\n",
        "clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and\n",
        "that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother\n",
        "was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on\n",
        "the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in\n",
        "the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I\n",
        "expect nothing more.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And the little girl--my pupil!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for\n",
        "her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here\n",
        "she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse.\"  The enigma then\n",
        "was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but\n",
        "a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the\n",
        "contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and\n",
        "me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much\n",
        "the better--my position was all the freer.\n",
        "\n",
        "As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her\n",
        "attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not\n",
        "at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or\n",
        "eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a\n",
        "redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Good morning, Miss Adela,\" said Mrs. Fairfax.  \"Come and speak to the\n",
        "lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.\"  She\n",
        "approached.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"C'est la ma gouverante!\" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her\n",
        "nurse; who answered--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Mais oui, certainement.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Are they foreigners?\" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I\n",
        "believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came\n",
        "here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a\n",
        "little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will\n",
        "make out her meaning very well, I dare say.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French\n",
        "lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot\n",
        "as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt\n",
        "a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my\n",
        "accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my\n",
        "teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in\n",
        "the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle\n",
        "Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her\n",
        "governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to\n",
        "her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were\n",
        "seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her\n",
        "large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ah!\" cried she, in French, \"you speak my language as well as Mr.\n",
        "Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She\n",
        "will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.\n",
        "Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a\n",
        "chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was\n",
        "Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a\n",
        "pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another\n",
        "place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And\n",
        "Mademoiselle--what is your name?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Eyre--Jane Eyre.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,\n",
        "before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very\n",
        "dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came\n",
        "from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,\n",
        "and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a\n",
        "beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We\n",
        "stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a\n",
        "great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many\n",
        "children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I\n",
        "fed with crumbs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?\" asked Mrs. Fairfax.\n",
        "\n",
        "I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent\n",
        "tongue of Madame Pierrot.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I wish,\" continued the good lady, \"you would ask her a question or two\n",
        "about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Adele,\" I inquired, \"with whom did you live when you were in that pretty\n",
        "clean town you spoke of?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama\n",
        "used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many\n",
        "gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,\n",
        "or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you\n",
        "hear me sing now?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of\n",
        "her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed\n",
        "herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,\n",
        "shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced\n",
        "singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,\n",
        "who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;\n",
        "desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest\n",
        "robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove\n",
        "to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has\n",
        "affected her.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose\n",
        "the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy\n",
        "warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:\n",
        "at least I thought so.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her\n",
        "age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, \"Now,\n",
        "Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Assuming an attitude, she began, \"La Ligue des Rats: fable de La\n",
        "Fontaine.\"  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to\n",
        "punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness\n",
        "of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been\n",
        "carefully trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?\" I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui\n",
        "dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me\n",
        "to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you\n",
        "say, with whom did you live then?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is\n",
        "nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a\n",
        "house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would\n",
        "like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.\n",
        "Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and\n",
        "gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,\n",
        "for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,\n",
        "and I never see him.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it\n",
        "appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.\n",
        "Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one\n",
        "bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way\n",
        "of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,\n",
        "biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that\n",
        "these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,\n",
        "indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty\n",
        "pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to\n",
        "offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this\n",
        "room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;\n",
        "also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.\n",
        "\n",
        "I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she\n",
        "had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be\n",
        "injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to\n",
        "her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had\n",
        "advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed\n",
        "to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her\n",
        "use.\n",
        "\n",
        "As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax\n",
        "called to me: \"Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,\" said\n",
        "she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in\n",
        "when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple\n",
        "chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast\n",
        "window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.\n",
        "Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a\n",
        "sideboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What a beautiful room!\" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never\n",
        "before seen any half so imposing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in\n",
        "a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that\n",
        "are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it\n",
        "with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad\n",
        "steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy\n",
        "place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was\n",
        "merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread\n",
        "with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;\n",
        "both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath\n",
        "which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the\n",
        "ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian\n",
        "glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the\n",

        "gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the\n",
        "past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of\n",
        "these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on\n",
        "one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of\n",

        "level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over\n",
        "the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out\n",
        "like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of\n",
        "the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;\n",

        "moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,\n",
        "the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon\n",
        "bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No\n",
        "feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I\n",
        "turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way\n",
        "down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that\n",
        "arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene\n",
        "of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and\n",

        "of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the\n",
        "narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this\n",
        "led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,\n",
        "low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,\n",
        "with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some\n",

        "\n",
        "While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a\n",

        "formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it\n",
        "began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It\n",
        "passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every\n",
        "lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed\n",
        "out the door whence the accents issued.\n",
        "\n",

        "\"Some of the servants, very likely,\" she answered: \"perhaps Grace Poole.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Did you hear it?\" I again inquired.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.\n",
        "Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\"Grace!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\n",
        "\n",

        "noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious\n",
        "cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should\n",

        "glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct\n",
        "object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a\n",
        "lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,\n",
        "quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,\n",
        "in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall\n",
        "steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the\n",
        "spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and\n",
        "goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of\n",

        "exclamation of \"What the deuce is to do now?\" and a clattering tumble,\n",
        "arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the\n",
        "sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and\n",
        "seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked\n",
        "till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to\n",
        "his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up\n",
        "to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to\n",
        "summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time\n",
        "struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I\n",
        "thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Can I do anything?\" I asked again.\n",
        "\n",

        "knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,\n",
        "clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me\n",
        "effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away\n",
        "till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was\n",
        "re-established, and the dog was silenced with a \"Down, Pilot!\"  The\n",
        "traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they\n",

        "the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He\n",
        "had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and\n",
        "gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,\n",

        "engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"When is his tea-time?\" I inquired.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better\n",
        "change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a\n",
        "candle.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is it necessary to change my frock?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester\n",
        "is here.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to\n",
        "my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by\n",
        "one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one\n",
        "of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too\n",
        "fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You want a brooch,\" said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl\n",
        "ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,\n",
        "and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather\n",
        "a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I\n",
        "let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade\n",
        "as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was\n",
        "now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;\n",
        "basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt\n",
        "near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot\n",
        "supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire\n",
        "shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty\n",
        "eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of\n",
        "his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for\n",
        "character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;\n",
        "his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no\n",
        "mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in\n",
        "squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the\n",
        "athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though\n",
        "neither tall nor graceful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and\n",
        "myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never\n",
        "lifted his head as we approached.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Here is Miss Eyre, sir,\" said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,\n",
        "still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Let Miss Eyre be seated,\" said he: and there was something in the forced\n",
        "stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to\n",
        "express, \"What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?\n",
        "At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness\n",
        "would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it\n",
        "by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me\n",
        "under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the\n",
        "freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the\n",
        "proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.\n",
        "\n",
        "He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.\n",
        "Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and\n",
        "she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she\n",
        "condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the\n",
        "annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she\n",
        "commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Madam, I should like some tea,\" was the sole rejoinder she got.  She\n",
        "hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to\n",
        "arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went\n",
        "to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?\" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; \"Adele\n",
        "might perhaps spill it.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the\n",
        "moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans\n",
        "votre petit coffre?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Who talks of cadeaux?\" said he gruffly.  \"Did you expect a present, Miss\n",
        "Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?\" and he searched my face with eyes that\n",
        "I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally\n",
        "thought pleasant things.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer\n",
        "worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?\n",
        "and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its\n",
        "nature.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a\n",
        "'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can\n",
        "prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for\n",
        "she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but\n",
        "if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,\n",
        "and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find\n",
        "you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no\n",
        "talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the\n",
        "meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Humph!\" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Come to the fire,\" said the master, when the tray was taken away, and\n",
        "Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was\n",
        "leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and\n",
        "ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty\n",
        "bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to\n",
        "amuse herself with Pilot.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You have been resident in my house three months?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And you came from--?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"From Lowood school, in ---shire.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Eight years.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in\n",
        "such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have\n",
        "rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that\n",
        "sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought\n",
        "unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you\n",
        "had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I have none.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on\n",

        "\n",
        "\"For whom, sir?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I\n",
        "break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the\n",
        "causeway?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I shook my head.  \"The men in green all forsook England a hundred years\n",
        "ago,\" said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  \"And not even in Hay\n",
        "Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't\n",
        "think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their\n",
        "revels more.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed\n",
        "wondering what sort of talk this was.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well,\" resumed Mr. Rochester, \"if you disown parents, you must have some\n",
        "sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No; none that I ever saw.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes,\" said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, \"and I\n",
        "am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre\n",
        "has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to\n",
        "Adele.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character,\" returned Mr. Rochester:\n",
        "\"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by\n",

        "\"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of\n",
        "Thornfield.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Have you read much?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or\n",

        "\n",
        "\"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in\n",
        "religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a\n",
        "parson, is he not?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Oh, no.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That\n",
        "sounds blasphemous.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is\n",
        "a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for\n",
        "economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could\n",
        "hardly sew.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That was very false economy,\" remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again\n",

        "\n",
        "\"And was that the head and front of his offending?\" demanded Mr.\n",
        "Rochester.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision\n",
        "department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long\n",
        "lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own\n",
        "inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go\n",
        "to bed.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have\n",
        "been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the\n",
        "features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And\n",
        "now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A little.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,\n",

        "inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the\n",
        "door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I departed, obeying his directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Enough!\" he called out in a few minutes.  \"You play _a little_, I see;\n",
        "like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but\n",
        "not well.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--\"Adele showed\n",
        "me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know\n",
        "whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, indeed!\" I interjected.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch\n",

        "certain: I can recognise patchwork.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I brought the portfolio from the library.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Approach the table,\" said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and\n",
        "Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No crowding,\" said Mr. Rochester: \"take the drawings from my hand as I\n",
        "finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid\n",
        "aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,\" said he, \"and look at\n",
        "them with Adele;--you\" (glancing at me) \"resume your seat, and answer my\n",
        "questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that\n",
        "hand yours?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and\n",

        "He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.\n",
        "\n",
        "While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and\n",
        "first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,\n",
        "indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,\n",
        "before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would\n",
        "not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale\n",
        "portrait of the thing I had conceived.\n",
        "\n",
        "These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low\n",
        "and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;\n",
        "so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there\n",
        "was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged\n",
        "mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with\n",
        "foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched\n",
        "with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering\n",
        "distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,\n",
        "a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only\n",
        "limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,\n",
        "with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above\n",
        "spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky\n",
        "was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I\n",
        "could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments\n",
        "below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark\n",
        "and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm\n",
        "or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like\n",
        "moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from\n",
        "which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:\n",
        "a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along\n",
        "the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a\n",
        "head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against\n",
        "it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew\n",
        "up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white\n",
        "as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the\n",
        "glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst\n",
        "wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and\n",
        "consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles\n",
        "of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was \"the likeness of a kingly\n",
        "crown;\" what it diademed was \"the shape which shape had none.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?\" asked Mr. Rochester\n",
        "presently.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was\n",
        "to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must\n",
        "have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not\n",
        "at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what\n",
        "meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?\n",

        "to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did\n",

        "that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of\n",
        "the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were\n",
        "not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and\n",
        "Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a\n",
        "painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise\n",
        "nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could\n",
        "not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he\n",
        "broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled\n",
        "kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for\n",
        "a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left\n",
        "him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the\n",
        "mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,\n",
        "gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed\n",
        "to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse\n",
        "exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he\n",
        "generally did not come back till late at night.\n",
        "\n",
        "During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and\n",
        "all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in\n",
        "the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass\n",
        "me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod\n",
        "or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike\n",
        "affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I\n",
        "had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on\n",
        "causes quite disconnected with me.\n",
        "\n",
        "One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in\n",
        "order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,\n",
        "to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but\n",
        "the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.\n",
        "Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and\n",
        "Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,\n",
        "and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where\n",
        "there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided\n",
        "locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering\n",
        "whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some\n",
        "mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there\n",
        "it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.\n",
        "She appeared to know it by instinct.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ma boite! ma boite!\" exclaimed she, running towards it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine\n",
        "daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,\" said the\n",
        "deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the\n",
        "depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  \"And mind,\" he\n",
        "continued, \"don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,\n",
        "or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be\n",
        "conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a\n",
        "sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the\n",
        "lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery\n",
        "envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!\" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic\n",
        "contemplation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is Miss Eyre there?\" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat\n",
        "to look round to the door, near which I still stood.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.\"  He drew a chair near his own.\n",
        "\"I am not fond of the prattle of children,\" he continued; \"for, old\n",
        "bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their\n",
        "lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening\n",
        "_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;\n",
        "sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound\n",
        "these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly\n",
        "affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;\n",
        "it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is\n",
        "said to be thicker than water.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,\n",
        "knitting-basket in hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have\n",
        "forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting\n",
        "with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and\n",
        "interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever\n",
        "performed.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her\n",
        "sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the\n",
        "waxen contents of her \"boite;\" pouring out, meantime, explanations and\n",
        "raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now I have performed the part of a good host,\" pursued Mr. Rochester,\n",
        "\"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at\n",
        "liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a\n",
        "little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you\n",
        "without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no\n",
        "mind to do.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in\n",
        "the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it\n",
        "seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been\n",
        "lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large\n",
        "fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample\n",
        "before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the\n",
        "subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each\n",
        "pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to\n",
        "what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.\n",
        "There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine\n",
        "or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,\n",
        "in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-\n",
        "indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he\n",
        "looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling\n",
        "back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-\n",
        "hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,\n",
        "and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths\n",
        "sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that\n",
        "feeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the\n",
        "same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze\n",
        "fastened on his physiognomy.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You examine me, Miss Eyre,\" said he: \"do you think me handsome?\"\n",

        "I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by\n",

        "from my tongue before I was aware--\"No, sir.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you,\" said he: \"you\n",
        "have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as\n",
        "you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the\n",
        "carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;\n",
        "as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a\n",
        "remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,\n",
        "which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that\n",
        "it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about\n",
        "appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little\n",
        "consequence, or something of that sort.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,\n",

        "stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under\n",
        "my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have\n",
        "all my limbs and all my features like any other man?\"\n",

        "He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his\n",
        "brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an\n",
        "abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?\"\n",

        "children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a\n",

        "prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,\n",

        "the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but\n",
        "still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with\n",
        "smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence\n",
        "these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of\n",
        "burning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,\n",
        "and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.\n",
        "Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I\n",
        "was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the\n",
        "curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester\n",
        "lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Wake! wake!\" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the\n",
        "smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets\n",
        "were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide\n",
        "and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,\n",
        "deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my\n",
        "own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in\n",
        "extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung\n",
        "from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the\n",
        "shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.\n",
        "Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him\n",
        "fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of\n",
        "water.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is there a flood?\" he cried.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, sir,\" I answered; \"but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are\n",

        "\n",
        "\"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?\" he\n",

        "\n",
        "\"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two\n",
        "minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here\n",
        "is my dressing-gown.  Now run!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He\n",
        "took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and\n",
        "scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What is it? and who did it?\" he asked.  I briefly related to him what\n",
        "had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step\n",
        "ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had\n",
        "conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and\n",
        "how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.\n",
        "\n",
        "{\"What is it and who did it?\" he asked: p140.jpg}\n",
        "\n",
        "He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm\n",
        "enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in\n",
        "the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the\n",
        "stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few\n",
        "minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;\n",
        "be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't\n",

        "softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,\n",
        "shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total\n",
        "darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long\n",
        "time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then\n",
        "I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was\n",
        "on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his\n",
        "orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I\n",
        "heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  \"I hope it is he,\" thought I,\n",

        "\n",
        "He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  \"I have found it all out,\" said he,\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,\n",
        "singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am\n",
        "glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the\n",
        "precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say\n",

        "I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed\n",
        "this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to\n",
        "meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily\n",
        "expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the\n",
        "schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the\n",
        "impression that he was sure to visit it that day.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the\n",
        "quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some\n",
        "bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's\n",
        "voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's\n",
        "own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of \"What a mercy master was not\n",
        "burnt in his bed!\"  \"It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at\n",
        "night.\"  \"How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the\n",
        "water-jug!\"  \"I wonder he waked nobody!\"  \"It is to be hoped he will not\n",
        "take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,\" &c.\n",
        "\n",
        "To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to\n",
        "rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw\n",
        "through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only\n",
        "the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,\n",
        "rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address\n",
        "her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,\n",
        "on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a\n",
        "chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was\n",
        "no other than Grace Poole.\n",
        "\n",
        "There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff\n",
        "gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on\n",
        "her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard\n",
        "forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the\n",
        "paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the\n",
        "countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended\n",
        "victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),\n",
        "charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was\n",
        "amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,\n",
        "no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of\n",
        "guilt, or fear of detection.  She said \"Good morning, Miss,\" in her usual\n",
        "phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,\n",
        "went on with her sewing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I will put her to some test,\" thought I: \"such absolute impenetrability\n",
        "is past comprehension.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Good morning, Grace,\" I said.  \"Has anything happened here?  I thought I\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with\n",
        "his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke\n",
        "before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench\n",
        "the flames with the water in the ewer.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A strange affair!\" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her\n",
        "fixedly--\"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of\n",
        "consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then\n",
        "she answered--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely\n",
        "to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but\n",
        "Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often\n",
        "sleep heavy.\"  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed\n",
        "indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--\"But you are\n",
        "young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard\n",
        "a noise?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I did,\" said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing\n",
        "the panes, could not hear me, \"and at first I thought it was Pilot: but\n",
        "Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her\n",
        "needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he\n",
        "was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I was not dreaming,\" I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness\n",
        "provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and\n",
        "conscious eye.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?\" she inquired.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the\n",
        "gallery?\" she further asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me\n",
        "information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew\n",
        "or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant\n",
        "pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"On the contrary,\" said I, \"I bolted my door.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before\n",
        "you get into bed?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans\n",
        "accordingly!\"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied\n",
        "sharply, \"Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not\n",
        "think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be\n",
        "dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future\" (and I laid marked stress on\n",
        "the words) \"I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to\n",
        "lie down.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It will be wise so to do,\" was her answer: \"this neighbourhood is as\n",
        "quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by\n",
        "robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth\n",
        "of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a\n",
        "large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived\n",
        "here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little\n",
        "waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is\n",
        "soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any\n",
        "mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all\n",
        "to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,\n",
        "though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.\"  And here\n",

        "demureness of a Quakeress.\n",
        "\n",
        "I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her\n",

        "I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during\n",

        "position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into\n",
        "custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's\n",
        "service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her\n",
        "criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing\n",
        "her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,\n",
        "vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of\n",
        "the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she\n",

        "would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she\n",
        "had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;\n",
        "but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of\n",
        "character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.\n",
        "Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric\n",
        "at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so\n",
        "sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she\n",
        "now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own\n",
        "indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?\"  But,\n",
        "having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat\n",
        "figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my\n",
        "mind's eye, that I thought, \"No; impossible! my supposition cannot be\n",
        "correct.  Yet,\" suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own\n",
        "hearts, \"you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves\n",
        "you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last\n",
        "night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment\n",
        "vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent\n",
        "over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?\" said she.  \"Vos doigts tremblent comme la\n",
        "feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!\"  She went on sketching; I went on\n",
        "thinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving\n",
        "respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and\n",
        "found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and\n",
        "she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did\n",
        "when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more\n",
        "vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Evening approaches,\" said I, as I looked towards the window.  \"I have\n",
        "never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely\n",
        "I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I\n",
        "desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown\n",
        "impatient.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the\n",
        "nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the\n",
        "bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I\n",
        "fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the\n",
        "door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;\n",
        "darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he\n",
        "often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.\n",
        "Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many\n",
        "things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace\n",
        "Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if\n",
        "he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;\n",
        "and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered\n",
        "whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and\n",
        "soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure\n",
        "instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of\n",
        "provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my\n",
        "skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my\n",
        "station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy\n",
        "restraint; this suited both him and me.\n",
        "\n",
        "A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it\n",
        "was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither\n",
        "I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I\n",
        "imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You must want your tea,\" said the good lady, as I joined her; \"you ate\n",
        "so little at dinner.  I am afraid,\" she continued, \"you are not well to-\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Do you expect him back to-night?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a\n",

        "so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can\n",
        "please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen\n",
        "especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is\n",
        "so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general\n",
        "favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think\n",
        "his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:\n",
        "but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good\n",

        "\n",
        "\"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies\n",

        "years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a\n",
        "Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the\n",
        "dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit\n",
        "up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of\n",

        "Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to\n",
        "hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to\n",
        "come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw\n",
        "a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of\n",
        "them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram\n",

        "\n",

        "she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:\n",
        "a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest\n",
        "curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf\n",
        "was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and\n",
        "descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to\n",

        "Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large\n",

        "would have Sophie to look over all her \"toilettes,\" as she called frocks;\n",
        "to furbish up any that were \"_passees_,\" and to air and arrange the new.\n",
        "For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump\n",
        "on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters\n",
        "and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From\n",
        "school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her\n",
        "service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her\n",
        "and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French\n",
        "pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for\n",
        "dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse\n",
        "chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele\n",
        "excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my\n",
        "cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of\n",
        "doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to\n",
        "see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept\n",
        "locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim\n",
        "cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the\n",
        "gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look\n",
        "into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to\n",
        "the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble\n",
        "mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She\n",
        "would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a\n",
        "moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with\n",
        "her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one\n",
        "hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all\n",
        "the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the\n",
        "second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to\n",
        "herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.\n",
        "\n",
        "The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,\n",
        "noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her\n",
        "position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,\n",
        "indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the\n",
        "charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying\n",
        "something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She gets good wages, I guess?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes,\" said Leah; \"I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain\n",
        "of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of\n",
        "the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every\n",
        "quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved\n",
        "enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's\n",
        "got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able\n",
        "for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She is a good hand, I daresay,\" said the charwoman.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better,\" rejoined Leah\n",
        "significantly; \"and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all\n",
        "the money she gets.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That it is not!\" was the reply.  \"I wonder whether the master--\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and\n",
        "she instantly gave her companion a nudge.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Doesn't she know?\" I heard the woman whisper.\n",
        "\n",
        "Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I\n",
        "had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at\n",
        "Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely\n",
        "excluded.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets\n",
        "were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes\n",
        "spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:\n",
        "both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make\n",
        "them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as\n",
        "the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness\n",
        "of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with\n",
        "plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all\n",
        "sides.\n",
        "\n",
        "Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her\n",
        "gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the\n",
        "company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be\n",
        "dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to\n",
        "the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to\n",
        "apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had\n",
        "no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my\n",
        "sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--\"a\n",
        "very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards\n",
        "the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth\n",
        "as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was\n",
        "even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It gets late,\" said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  \"I am\n",
        "glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for\n",
        "it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there\n",
        "is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the\n",
        "direction of Millcote.\"  She went to the window.  \"Here he is!\" said she.\n",
        "\"Well, John\" (leaning out), \"any news?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"They're coming, ma'am,\" was the answer.  \"They'll be here in ten\n",
        "minutes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,\n",
        "so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were\n",
        "heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two\n",
        "open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;\n",
        "two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was\n",
        "Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at\n",
        "his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her\n",
        "purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on\n",
        "the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through\n",
        "them, shone rich raven ringlets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Miss Ingram!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post\n",
        "below.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle\n",
        "of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;\n",
        "but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not\n",
        "on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or\n",
        "at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be\n",
        "very angry, &c.  \"Some natural tears she shed\" on being told this; but as\n",
        "I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.\n",
        "\n",
        "A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and\n",
        "ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable\n",
        "above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of\n",
        "Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.\n",
        "Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through\n",
        "the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,\n",
        "and, for a time, a hush.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Elles changent de toilettes,\" said Adele; who, listening attentively,\n",
        "had followed every movement; and she sighed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Chez maman,\" said she, \"quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais\n",
        "partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de\n",
        "chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela\n",
        "on apprend.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas\n",
        "mange.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and\n",
        "get you something to eat.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which\n",
        "conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and\n",
        "commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and\n",
        "the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening\n",
        "spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three\n",
        "gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I\n",
        "suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had\n",
        "been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this\n",
        "chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold\n",
        "chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and\n",
        "fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the\n",
        "gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an\n",
        "accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their\n",
        "chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of\n",
        "their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of\n",
        "victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was\n",
        "dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each\n",
        "came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the\n",
        "dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of\n",
        "the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then\n",
        "descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down\n",
        "a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-\n",
        "born elegance, such as I had never before received.\n",
        "\n",
        "I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.\n",
        "\"What beautiful ladies!\" cried she in English.  \"Oh, I wish I might go to\n",
        "them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after\n",
        "dinner?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.\n",
        "Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here\n",
        "is your dinner.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her\n",
        "attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,\n",
        "and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a\n",
        "chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much\n",
        "engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine\n",
        "and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-\n",
        "cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared\n",
        "she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and\n",
        "shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message\n",
        "might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; \"et alors\n",
        "quel dommage!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a\n",
        "change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and\n",
        "it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing\n",
        "backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of\n",
        "music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;\n",
        "Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently\n",
        "a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who\n",
        "sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and\n",
        "then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I\n",
        "listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on\n",
        "analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the\n",
        "confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,\n",
        "which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered\n",
        "by distance inarticulate, into words.\n",
        "\n",
        "The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my\n",
        "shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and\n",
        "carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies\n",
        "sought their chambers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party\n",
        "to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in\n",
        "the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both\n",
        "the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady\n",
        "equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two\n",
        "rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to\n",
        "Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You said it was not likely they should think of being married,\" said I,\n",
        "\"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other\n",
        "ladies.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And she him,\" I added; \"look how she leans her head towards him as if\n",
        "she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have\n",
        "never had a glimpse of it yet.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You will see her this evening,\" answered Mrs. Fairfax.  \"I happened to\n",
        "remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the\n",
        "ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after\n",
        "dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,\" I\n",
        "answered.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not\n",
        "think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and\n",
        "he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is\n",
        "my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in\n",
        "case of contumacy.'\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I will not give him that trouble,\" I answered.  \"I will go, if no better\n",
        "may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage\n",
        "so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is\n",
        "the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-\n",
        "room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose\n",
        "your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the\n",
        "gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are\n",
        "there and then slip away--nobody will notice you.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Will these people remain long, do you think?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter\n",
        "recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will\n",
        "have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will\n",
        "accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a\n",
        "stay at Thornfield.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I\n",
        "was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a\n",
        "state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the\n",
        "ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation\n",
        "of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the\n",
        "process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged\n",
        "in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her\n",
        "long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any\n",
        "judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was\n",
        "dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care\n",
        "previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and\n",
        "assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly\n",
        "was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's\n",
        "wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon\n",
        "smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We\n",
        "descended.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that\n",
        "through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the\n",
        "apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and\n",
        "wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with\n",
        "which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:\n",
        "slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the\n",
        "adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their\n",
        "conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising\n",
        "impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to\n",
        "her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,\n",
        "endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she\n",
        "touched my knee.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What is it, Adele?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,\n",
        "mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a\n",
        "flower.\"  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She\n",
        "sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were\n",
        "now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:\n",
        "there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little\n",
        "Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.\n",
        "\n",
        "A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back\n",
        "from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre\n",
        "pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent\n",
        "dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the\n",
        "opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.\n",
        "\n",
        "There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the\n",
        "impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many\n",
        "were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that\n",
        "seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and\n",
        "curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only\n",
        "stared at me.\n",
        "\n",
        "They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and\n",
        "buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of\n",
        "them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and\n",
        "ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:\n",
        "the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but\n",
        "clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,\n",
        "and may as well mention them now.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently\n",
        "been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,\n",
        "the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and\n",
        "manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became\n",
        "her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;\n",
        "with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:\n",
        "both sisters were fair as lilies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,\n",
        "very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:\n",
        "her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and\n",
        "within the circlet of a band of gems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She\n",
        "had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin\n",
        "dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased\n",
        "me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.\n",
        "\n",
        "But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest\n",
        "figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,\n",
        "Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.\n",
        "The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;\n",
        "her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were\n",
        "still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid\n",
        "woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then\n",
        "there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her\n",
        "bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,\n",
        "disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me\n",
        "not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the\n",
        "chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost\n",
        "preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it\n",
        "reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice\n",
        "was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very\n",
        "intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some\n",
        "gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a\n",
        "truly imperial dignity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.\n",
        "Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I\n",
        "regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see\n",
        "whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;\n",
        "secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted\n",
        "of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy\n",
        "likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.\n",
        "\n",
        "As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture\n",
        "and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,\n",
        "the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but\n",
        "her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed\n",
        "likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It\n",
        "was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her\n",
        "laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and\n",
        "haughty lip.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram\n",
        "was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious\n",
        "indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.\n",
        "Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she\n",
        "said, she liked flowers, \"especially wild ones;\" Miss Ingram had, and she\n",
        "ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what\n",
        "is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her\n",
        "ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-\n",
        "natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice\n",
        "was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,\n",
        "with fluency and with a good accent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features\n",
        "too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a\n",
        "Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,\n",
        "her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,\n",
        "remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired\n",
        "in spotless white.\n",
        "\n",
        "And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be\n",
        "likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female\n",
        "beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then\n",
        "she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I\n",
        "thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained\n",
        "proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them\n",
        "together.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting\n",
        "motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she\n",
        "rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with\n",
        "gravity--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Bon jour, mesdames.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,\n",
        "\"Oh, what a little puppet!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Lady Lynn had remarked, \"It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the\n",
        "little French girl he was speaking of.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.\n",
        "\n",
        "Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--\"What a love of a\n",
        "child!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced\n",
        "between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;\n",
        "absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton\n",
        "and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.\n",
        "\n",
        "At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in\n",
        "the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the\n",
        "window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The\n",
        "collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very\n",
        "imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some\n",
        "young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and\n",
        "Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the\n",
        "district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and\n",
        "whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a\n",
        "\"pere noble de theatre.\"  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;\n",
        "like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and\n",
        "listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of\n",
        "blood or vigour of brain.\n",
        "\n",
        "And where is Mr. Rochester?\n",
        "\n",
        "He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I\n",
        "try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes\n",
        "of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my\n",
        "hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;\n",
        "whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the\n",
        "moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,\n",
        "an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my\n",
        "face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to\n",
        "overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him\n",
        "at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my\n",
        "relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So\n",
        "far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did\n",
        "not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side\n",
        "of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.\n",
        "\n",
        "No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I\n",
        "might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily\n",
        "to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,\n",
        "and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in\n",
        "looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely\n",
        "point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel\n",
        "who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and\n",
        "drinks divine draughts nevertheless.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most true is it that \"beauty is in the eye of the gazer.\"  My master's\n",

        "deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,\n",
        "will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than\n",
        "beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite\n",
        "mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them\n",
        "in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought\n",
        "hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,\n",
        "at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and\n",
        "strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.\n",
        "\n",
        "I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,\n",

        "Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?\n",
        "I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could\n",
        "imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,\n",
        "imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured\n",
        "and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the\n",
        "light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of\n",
        "the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester\n",
        "smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and\n",
        "gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,\n",
        "to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that\n",

        "though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and\n",

        "light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,\n",
        "vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must\n",
        "conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he\n",
        "cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not\n",
        "mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean\n",
        "only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,\n",
        "then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I\n",

        "Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how\n",
        "different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and\n",
        "solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now\n",
        "driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life\n",
        "everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the\n",
        "gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so\n",
        "tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.\n",
        "\n",
        "The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,\n",
        "were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when\n",
        "the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called\n",
        "their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,\n",
        "and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over\n",
        "enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in\n",
        "consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.\n",
        "\n",
        "I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of\n",
        "entertainment was proposed: they spoke of \"playing charades,\" but in my\n",
        "ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,\n",
        "the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the\n",
        "chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and\n",
        "the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running\n",
        "up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to\n",
        "give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,\n",
        "dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey\n",
        "were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped\n",
        "petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought\n",
        "down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such\n",
        "things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the\n",
        "drawing-room.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was\n",
        "selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  \"Miss Ingram is\n",
        "mine, of course,\" said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and\n",
        "Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been\n",
        "fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Will you play?\" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I\n",
        "rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my\n",
        "usual seat.\n",
        "\n",
        "He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which\n",
        "was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of\n",
        "the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should\n",
        "be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No,\" I heard her say: \"she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the\n",
        "bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,\n",
        "was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a\n",
        "large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's\n",
        "cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell\n",
        "merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's\n",
        "party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of\n",
        "flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of\n",
        "Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of\n",
        "roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they\n",
        "drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,\n",
        "dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony\n",
        "followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime\n",
        "of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted\n",
        "in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Bride!\" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\n",
        "\n",
        "A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising\n",
        "displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-\n",
        "room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-\n",
        "room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within\n",
        "the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an\n",
        "ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by\n",
        "exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been\n",
        "transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,\n",
        "costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy\n",
        "skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very\n",
        "model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.\n",
        "Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in\n",
        "oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an\n",
        "embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her\n",
        "beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\n",
        "supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of\n",
        "form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea\n",
        "of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was\n",
        "doubtless the character she intended to represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she\n",
        "again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed\n",
        "to accost her; to make some request:--\"She hasted, let down her pitcher\n",
        "on her hand, and gave him to drink.\"  From the bosom of his robe he then\n",
        "produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and\n",
        "earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the\n",
        "treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks\n",
        "and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the\n",
        "rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were\n",
        "wanting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could\n",
        "not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel\n",
        "Dent, their spokesman, demanded \"the tableau of the whole;\" whereupon the\n",
        "curtain again descended.\n",
        "\n",
        "On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the\n",
        "rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse\n",
        "drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table\n",
        "and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light\n",
        "proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.\n",
        "\n",
        "Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on\n",
        "his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though\n",
        "the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one\n",
        "arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the\n",
        "desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well\n",
        "have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were\n",
        "attached fetters.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Bridewell!\" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.\n",
        "\n",
        "A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their\n",
        "ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in\n",
        "Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Do you know,\" said she, \"that, of the three characters, I liked you in\n",
        "the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant\n",
        "gentleman-highwayman you would have made!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is all the soot washed from my face?\" he asked, turning it towards her.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your\n",
        "complexion than that ruffian's rouge.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You would like a hero of the road then?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian\n",
        "bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour\n",
        "since, in the presence of all these witnesses.\"  She giggled, and her\n",
        "colour rose.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, Dent,\" continued Mr. Rochester, \"it is your turn.\"  And as the\n",
        "other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss\n",
        "Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners\n",
        "filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the\n",
        "actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my\n",
        "attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the\n",
        "arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What\n",
        "charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they\n",
        "acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the\n",
        "consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss\n",
        "Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,\n",
        "till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his\n",
        "cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged\n",
        "glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle\n",
        "returns in memory at this moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could\n",
        "not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice\n",
        "me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once\n",
        "turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions\n",
        "appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her\n",
        "robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me\n",
        "by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to\n",
        "merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would\n",
        "soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security\n",
        "in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a\n",
        "style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought\n",
        "than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its\n",
        "very pride, irresistible.\n",
        "\n",
        "There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though\n",
        "much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender\n",
        "jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a\n",
        "woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the\n",
        "nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss\n",
        "Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the\n",
        "feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very\n",
        "showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant\n",

        "stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to\n",
        "witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;\n",
        "vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly\n",
        "pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled\n",

        "be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows\n",

        "marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first\n",
        "discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely\n",
        "to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but\n",
        "the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the\n",

        "the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan\n",

        "\n",
        "But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my\n",

        "sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of\n",
        "his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing\n",
        "of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm\n",
        "that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only\n",
        "like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but\n",
        "their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the\n",
        "vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a\n",
        "desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and\n",
        "then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange\n",
        "depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and\n",
        "shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and\n",
        "had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,\n",
        "at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with\n",
        "palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to\n",
        "divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might\n",

        "own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram\n",
        "continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two\n",
        "turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting\n",
        "gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on\n",
        "which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent\n",
        "talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a\n",
        "courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.\n",
        "Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord\n",
        "Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of\n",

        "all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram\n",

        "vivacity of conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one\n",

        "to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had\n",
        "proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond\n",
        "Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the\n",
        "stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing\n",
        "billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought\n",
        "solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,\n",
        "by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to\n",
        "draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental\n",
        "tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the\n",
        "library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and\n",
        "prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of\n",
        "absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the\n",
        "merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the\n",
        "hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the\n",
        "drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,\n",
        "looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a\n",
        "crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible\n",
        "on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What can possess him to come home in that style?\" said Miss Ingram.  \"He\n",
        "rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot\n",
        "was with him:--what has he done with the animals?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so\n",
        "near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking\n",
        "of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when\n",
        "she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The\n",
        "post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman\n",
        "alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was\n",
        "a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"How provoking!\" exclaimed Miss Ingram: \"you tiresome monkey!\"\n",
        "(apostrophising Adele), \"who perched you up in the window to give false\n",
        "intelligence?\" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.\n",
        "He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,\" said he, \"when my\n",
        "friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long\n",
        "journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate\n",
        "acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being\n",
        "somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether\n",
        "English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and\n",
        "forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a\n",
        "fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you\n",
        "detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to\n",
        "please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large\n",
        "and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at\n",
        "least so I thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till\n",
        "after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But\n",
        "I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at\n",
        "the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no\n",
        "meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never\n",
        "remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking\n",
        "man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that\n",
        "smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline\n",
        "nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even\n",
        "forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\n",
        "\n",
        "As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the\n",
        "girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an\n",
        "arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if\n",
        "he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference\n",
        "be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek\n",
        "gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated\n",
        "keen-eyed dog, its guardian.\n",
        "\n",
        "He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship\n",
        "theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage\n",
        "that \"extremes meet.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps\n",
        "of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much\n",
        "sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary\n",
        "Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that\n",
        "reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they\n",
        "both called him \"a beautiful man.\"  Louisa said he was \"a love of a\n",
        "creature,\" and she \"adored him;\" and Mary instanced his \"pretty little\n",
        "mouth, and nice nose,\" as her ideal of the charming.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!\" cried Louisa,--\"so\n",
        "smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such\n",
        "a placid eye and smile!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other\n",
        "side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to\n",
        "Hay Common.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and\n",
        "I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I\n",
        "learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from\n",
        "some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so\n",
        "sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the\n",
        "house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated\n",
        "the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I\n",
        "gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted\n",
        "with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning\n",
        "heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.\n",
        "Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought\n",
        "the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never\n",
        "heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected\n",
        "one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one\n",
        "chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,\n",
        "which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot\n",
        "and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near\n",
        "Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I\n",
        "heard only the words, \"old woman,\"--\"quite troublesome.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself\n",
        "off,\" replied the magistrate.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No--stop!\" interrupted Colonel Dent.  \"Don't send her away, Eshton; we\n",
        "might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.\"  And\n",
        "speaking aloud, he continued--\"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common\n",
        "to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches\n",
        "is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought\n",
        "in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to\n",
        "see her?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Surely, colonel,\" cried Lady Ingram, \"you would not encourage such a low\n",
        "impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,\" said the footman; \"nor\n",
        "can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating\n",
        "her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says\n",
        "nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What does she want?\" asked Mrs. Eshton.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she\n",
        "must and will do it.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"What is she like?\" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Why, she's a real sorceress!\" cried Frederick Lynn.  \"Let us have her\n",
        "in, of course.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"To be sure,\" rejoined his brother; \"it would be a thousand pities to\n",

        "\n",
        "\"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?\" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,\" chimed\n",
        "in the Dowager Ingram.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will,\" pronounced the haughty voice of\n",
        "Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had\n",
        "sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  \"I have a\n",
        "curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame\n",

        "\n",
        "The footman still lingered.  \"She looks such a rough one,\" said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Go!\" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.\n",
        "\n",
        "Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery\n",
        "and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She won't come now,\" said he.  \"She says it's not her mission to appear\n",
        "before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room\n",

        "one.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You see now, my queenly Blanche,\" began Lady Ingram, \"she encroaches.  Be\n",

        "\"Show her into the library, of course,\" cut in the \"angel girl.\"  \"It is\n",

        "Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself\n",
        "carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that\n",
        "had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had\n",
        "proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a\n",
        "servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that\n",
        "the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to\n",
        "pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When\n",
        "dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent\n",
        "grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed\n",
        "to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.\n",
        "\n",
        "No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in\n",
        "about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed\n",
        "that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon\n",
        "declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and\n",
        "darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left\n",
        "the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped\n",
        "to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Am I wanted?\" I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Are you up?\" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And dressed?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Come out, then, quietly.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I want you,\" he said: \"come this way: take your time, and make no\n",
        "noise.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.\n",
        "He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low\n",
        "corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his\n",
        "side.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Have you a sponge in your room?\" he asked in a whisper.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Have you any salts--volatile salts?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Go back and fetch both.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,\n",
        "and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his\n",
        "hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;\n",
        "he paused, and addressed me again.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Just give me your hand,\" he said: \"it will not do to risk a fainting\n",
        "fit.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I put my fingers into his.  \"Warm and steady,\" was his remark: he turned\n",
        "the key and opened the door.\n",
        "\n",
        "I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax\n",
        "showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was\n",
        "now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then\n",
        "been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room\n",
        "within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog\n",
        "quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, \"Wait a\n",
        "minute,\" and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter\n",
        "greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's\n",
        "own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of\n",
        "arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he\n",
        "came out and closed the door behind him.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Here, Jane!\" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large\n",
        "bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of\n",
        "the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,\n",
        "dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant\n",
        "back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I\n",
        "recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:\n",
        "I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in\n",
        "blood.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Hold the candle,\" said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin\n",
        "of water from the washstand: \"Hold that,\" said he.  I obeyed.  He took\n",
        "the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked\n",
        "for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason\n",
        "shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of\n",
        "the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away\n",
        "blood, trickling fast down.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is there immediate danger?\" murmured Mr. Mason.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll\n",
        "fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by\n",
        "morning, I hope.  Jane,\" he continued.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Sir?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,\n",
        "or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:\n",
        "if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his\n",
        "lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any\n",
        "pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak\n",
        "to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the\n",
        "consequences.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,\n",
        "either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.\n",
        "Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to\n",
        "use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,\n",
        "\"Remember!--No conversation,\" he left the room.  I experienced a strange\n",
        "feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating\n",
        "step ceased to be heard.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic\n",
        "cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and\n",
        "hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that\n",
        "was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of\n",
        "Grace Poole bursting out upon me.\n",
        "\n",
        "I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly\n",
        "countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now\n",
        "shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and\n",
        "ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and\n",
        "again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.\n",
        "I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the\n",
        "shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black\n",
        "under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the\n",
        "doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve\n",
        "panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each\n",
        "enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top\n",
        "rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.\n",
        "\n",
        "According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or\n",
        "glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his\n",
        "brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of\n",
        "Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and\n",
        "threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his\n",
        "subordinate's form.\n",
        "\n",
        "Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the\n",
        "movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since\n",
        "Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but\n",
        "three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal\n",
        "of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived\n",
        "incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor\n",
        "subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now\n",
        "in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,\n",
        "masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a\n",
        "mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?\n",
        "\n",
        "And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he\n",
        "become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?\n",
        "What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when\n",
        "he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him\n",
        "an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame\n",
        "under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit\n",
        "to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester\n",
        "enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a\n",
        "former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he\n",
        "smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was\n",
        "submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held\n",
        "complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had\n",
        "passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their\n",
        "former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been\n",
        "habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had\n",
        "arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why\n",
        "had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now\n",
        "sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a\n",
        "thunderbolt might fall on an oak?\n",
        "\n",
        "Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:\n",
        "\"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane.\"  I could not forget\n",
        "how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no\n",
        "light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the\n",
        "vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"When will he come?  When will he come?\" I cried inwardly, as the night\n",
        "lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:\n",
        "and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water\n",
        "to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:\n",
        "my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss\n",
        "of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He\n",
        "moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and\n",
        "I might not even speak to him.\n",
        "\n",
        "The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks\n",
        "of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.\n",
        "Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the\n",
        "courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more\n",
        "the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It\n",
        "could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed\n",
        "shorter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, Carter, be on the alert,\" he said to this last: \"I give you but\n",
        "half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the\n",
        "patient downstairs and all.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But is he fit to move, sir?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must\n",
        "be kept up.  Come, set to work.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let\n",
        "in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how\n",
        "far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the\n",
        "east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, my good fellow, how are you?\" he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She's done for me, I fear,\" was the faint reply.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the\n",
        "worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him\n",
        "there's no danger.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I can do that conscientiously,\" said Carter, who had now undone the\n",
        "bandages; \"only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have\n",
        "bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well\n",
        "as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth\n",
        "here!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She bit me,\" he murmured.  \"She worried me like a tigress, when\n",
        "Rochester got the knife from her.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,\"\n",
        "said Mr. Rochester.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But under such circumstances, what could one do?\" returned Mason.  \"Oh,\n",
        "it was frightful!\" he added, shuddering.  \"And I did not expect it: she\n",
        "looked so quiet at first.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I warned you,\" was his friend's answer; \"I said--be on your guard when\n",
        "you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had\n",
        "me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and\n",
        "alone.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I thought I could have done some good.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,\n",
        "however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not\n",
        "taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun\n",
        "will soon rise, and I must have him off.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other\n",
        "wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart,\" said Mason.\n",
        "\n",
        "I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,\n",
        "horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only\n",
        "said--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat\n",
        "it.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I wish I could forget it,\" was the answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish\n",
        "Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not\n",
        "think of her at all.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Impossible to forget this night!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as\n",
        "dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.\n",
        "There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a\n",
        "trice.  Jane\" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),\n",
        "\"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into\n",
        "my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a\n",
        "clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,\n",
        "and returned with them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now,\" said he, \"go to the other side of the bed while I order his\n",
        "toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I retired as directed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?\" inquired Mr.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"No, sir; all was very still.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your\n",
        "sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long\n",
        "to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,\n",
        "Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred\n",
        "cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold\n",
        "climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one\n",
        "next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and\n",
        "edged with fur.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, I've another errand for you,\" said my untiring master; \"you must\n",
        "away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a\n",
        "clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open\n",
        "the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a\n",
        "little glass you will find there,--quick!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a\n",
        "dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an\n",
        "Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a\n",
        "thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,\n",
        "for instance.  Jane, a little water.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on\n",
        "the washstand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it\n",
        "to Mason.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so.\"\n",

        "Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the\n",
        "liquid; he then took his arm--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now I am sure you can get on your feet,\" he said--\"try.\"\n",

        "harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same\n",
        "hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;\n",
        "and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of\n",
        "the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,\n",
        "and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,\n",

        "Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as\n",
        "Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There\n",
        "was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme\n",
        "plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen\n",
        "collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a\n",
        "string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though\n",
        "I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and\n",
        "colourless visage.\n",
        "\n",

        "full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular\n",
        "features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of\n",
        "her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her\n",
        "sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the\n",

        "daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden\n",
        "starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's\n",
        "movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a\n",
        "fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her\n",
        "away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever\n",
        "broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:\n",

        "\n",
        "\"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only\n",
        "sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning\n",
        "her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he\n",
        "wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated\n",
        "him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated\n",
        "it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!\n",
        "It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like\n",
        "any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used\n",
        "to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than\n",
        "he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children\n",
        "friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was\n",
        "angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he\n",
        "had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he\n",
        "died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been\n",
        "charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally\n",
        "weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:\n",
        "John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish\n",
        "he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more\n",
        "money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the\n",
        "servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never\n",
        "submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income\n",
        "goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and\n",
        "always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and\n",
        "degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She was getting much excited.  \"I think I had better leave her now,\" said\n",

        "mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in\n",
        "his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange\n",

        "\n",
        "More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.\n",

        "everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well\n",
        "as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at\n",
        "first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and\n",
        "scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would\n",
        "chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of\n",
        "me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or\n",
        "amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me\n",
        "for both.\n",
        "\n",
        "Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take\n",
        "a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching\n",
        "fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to\n",
        "shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse\n",
        "of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;\n",
        "a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-\n",
        "flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,\n",
        "under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.\n",
        "\n",
        "One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,\n",
        "I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad\n",
        "point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and\n",
        "prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour\n",
        "gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.\n",
        "Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then\n",
        "followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full\n",
        "nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm\n",
        "chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black\n",
        "whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and\n",
        "waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,\n",
        "because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I\n",
        "shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids\n",
        "lustrous and large.  \"Good! but not quite the thing,\" I thought, as I\n",
        "surveyed the effect: \"they want more force and spirit;\" and I wrought the\n",
        "shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy\n",
        "touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my\n",
        "gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs\n",
        "on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed\n",
        "and content.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Is that a portrait of some one you know?\" asked Eliza, who had\n",
        "approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,\n",
        "and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in\n",
        "fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that\n",
        "to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The\n",
        "other drawings pleased her much, but she called that \"an ugly man.\" They\n",
        "both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;\n",
        "and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her\n",
        "album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at\n",
        "once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we\n",
        "had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she\n",
        "had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent\n",
        "in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the\n",
        "attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest\n",
        "she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints\n",
        "were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and\n",
        "sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of\n",
        "fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The\n",
        "communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same\n",
        "theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once\n",
        "adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the\n",
        "present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly\n",
        "taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after\n",
        "dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her\n",
        "mother's sick-room, and no more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw\n",
        "a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what\n",
        "she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an\n",
        "alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before\n",
        "breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular\n",
        "portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she\n",
        "studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer\n",
        "Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and\n",
        "she said, \"the Rubric.\"  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold\n",
        "thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a\n",
        "carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she\n",
        "informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately\n",
        "erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to\n",
        "working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of\n",
        "her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe\n",
        "she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing\n",
        "annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to\n",
        "vary its clockwork regularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than\n",
        "usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had\n",
        "been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,\n",
        "settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had\n",
        "taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly\n",
        "improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or\n",
        "linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a\n",
        "retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from\n",
        "disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous\n",
        "world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had\n",
        "had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.\n",
        "Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time\n",
        "in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and\n",
        "wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an\n",
        "invitation up to town.  \"It would be so much better,\" she said, \"if she\n",
        "could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.\"  I\n",
        "did not ask what she meant by \"all being over,\" but I suppose she\n",
        "referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of\n",
        "funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's\n",
        "indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had\n",
        "been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and\n",
        "unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never\n",

        "no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a\n",
        "reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some\n",
        "other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or\n",

        "as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-\n",
        "girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,\n",
        "like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the\n",
        "cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield\n",
        "were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their\n",
        "dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted\n",
        "well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.\n",
        "\n",
        "On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay\n",
        "Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop\n",
        "asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--\"Day its fervid fires\n",
        "had wasted,\" and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.\n",
        "Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of\n",

        "furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and\n",
        "wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own\n",
        "charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary\n",

        "I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of\n",
        "a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a\n",
        "handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the\n",
        "orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it\n",
        "was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out\n",
        "from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it\n",
        "from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from\n",
        "lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a\n",
        "giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the\n",
        "fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such\n",

        "upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising\n",
        "moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not\n",
        "by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been\n",
        "yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of\n",
        "shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I\n",
        "look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear\n",
        "a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is\n",
        "visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.\n",
        "I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester\n",
        "entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he\n",
        "will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.\n",
        "\n",
        "But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden\n",

        "now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of\n",

        "their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at\n",

        "on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed\n",
        "and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if\n",

        "two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I\n",
        "watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the\n",
        "most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a\n",
        "new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a\n",
        "silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his\n",
        "choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I\n",
        "persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and\n",

        "\n",
        "Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a\n",
        "jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a\n",
        "sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I\n",
        "sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,\n",
        "dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John\n",

        "could better endure to be kept by him now.\"  And somewhat relieved by\n",
        "this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more\n",
        "to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought\n",
        "mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his\n",

        "speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to\n",

        "never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an\n",
        "hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads\n",

        "chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the\n",
        "centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each\n",
        "other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;\n",
        "though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:\n",
        "their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests\n",
        "would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might\n",
        "be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You did right to hold fast to each other,\" I said: as if the monster-\n",

        "bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep\n",
        "drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far\n",
        "away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to\n",
        "listen to, and I ran off again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with\n",
        "which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed\n",
        "myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the\n",
        "house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the\n",
        "library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew\n",
        "on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful\n",
        "hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and\n",
        "burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the\n",
        "table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in\n",
        "ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these\n",
        "arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a\n",
        "little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall\n",
        "simultaneously struck ten.\n",

        "coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but\n",

        "still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at\n",

        "\n",
        "A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and\n",

        "herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense\n",
        "cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!\" I exclaimed, seized with\n",
        "hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it\n",
        "was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of\n",
        "last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of\n",
        "disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had\n",

        "\n",

        "than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a\n",

        "ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,\n",
        "mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had\n",
        "opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his\n",
        "hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"There!\" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the\n",

        "\n",
        "I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I\n",
        "got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well\n",
        "as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, \"But is\n",

        "as a long, strong arm.\n",
        "\n",

        "short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said\n",
        "something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless\n",

        "fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to\n",
        "have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't\n",
        "caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in\n",
        "Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good\n",
        "and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air\n",
        "and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your\n",
        "journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of\n",
        "you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your\n",
        "actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,\n",
        "sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more\n",
        "so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows\n",
        "of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a\n",
        "dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the\n",
        "air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs\n",
        "to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in\n",
        "the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely\n",
        "extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I\n",
        "would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I\n",
        "smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your\n",
        "aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in\n",
        "the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the\n",
        "square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my\n",
        "low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could\n",
        "bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw\n",
        "plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,\n",
        "and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your\n",
        "wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a\n",
        "coronet.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"How well you read me, you witch!\" interposed Mr. Rochester: \"but what\n",
        "did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or\n",
        "a dagger, that you look so mournful now?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found\n",
        "nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,\n",
        "because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,\n",
        "the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and\n",
        "high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you\n",
        "were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair\n",
        "and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I\n",
        "could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale\n",
        "still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether\n",
        "in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,\n",
        "doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some\n",
        "dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I\n",
        "continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also\n",
        "the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful\n",
        "consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I\n",
        "was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed\n",
        "me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a\n",
        "very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in\n",
        "my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you\n",
        "were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to\n",
        "overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat\n",
        "you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away\n",
        "inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every\n",
        "moment.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to\n",
        "you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of\n",
        "real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;\n",
        "and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your\n",
        "lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but\n",
        "sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of\n",
        "living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,\n",
        "Jane?--repeat it.\"\n",

        "\"Well,\" he said, after some minutes' silence, \"it is strange; but that\n",
        "sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you\n",
        "said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward\n",
        "gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is\n",
        "too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know\n",
        "well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me\n",
        "you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be\n",
        "incensed than saddened.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have\n",
        "finished my tale: but hear me to the end.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source\n",
        "of your melancholy in a dream.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I shook my head.  \"What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be\n",
        "anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his\n",
        "manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the\n",
        "retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front\n",
        "nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very\n",
        "fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-\n",
        "grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there\n",
        "over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still\n",
        "carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,\n",
        "however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,\n",
        "I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the\n",
        "road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and\n",
        "for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous\n",
        "haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled\n",
        "from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung\n",
        "round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the\n",
        "summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.\n",
        "The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow\n",
        "ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the\n",
        "road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was\n",
        "shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and\n",
        "woke.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, Jane, that is all.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam\n",
        "dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it\n",
        "was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a\n",
        "light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before\n",
        "going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a\n",
        "rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;\n",
        "but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and\n",
        "surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I\n",
        "again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent\n",
        "forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my\n",
        "blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,\n",
        "it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Describe it, Jane.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Did you see her face?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held\n",

        "turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage\n",

        "\n",
        "\"And how were they?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was\n",

        "evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The\n",
        "explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the\n",
        "clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.\n",

        "clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his\n",
        "breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched\n",
        "towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, \"Wilt thou have this\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong\n",
        "grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive\n",
        "front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild\n",
        "beneath!\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  \"What is the nature of the impediment?\" he\n",

        "advisedly.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering\n",

        "to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt\n",
        "frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I\n",
        "looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was\n",
        "colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:\n",
        "he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without\n",
        "smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined\n",
        "my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" he asked of the intruder.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Certainly.\"  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read\n",

        "\"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of\n",

        "Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a\n",

        "spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second\n",
        "stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a\n",
        "pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason\n",
        "himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have\n",
        "often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in\n",
        "its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead\n",
        "received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,\n",
        "lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the\n",
        "church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but\n",
        "Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, \"Good God!\"  Contempt fell cool on\n",
        "Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he\n",
        "only asked--\"What have _you_ to say?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,\n",
        "what have you to say?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Sir--sir,\" interrupted the clergyman, \"do not forget you are in a sacred\n",
        "place.\"  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, \"Are you aware, sir,\n",
        "whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Courage,\" urged the lawyer,--\"speak out.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She is now living at Thornfield Hall,\" said Mason, in more articulate\n",
        "tones: \"I saw her there last April.  I am her brother.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"At Thornfield Hall!\" ejaculated the clergyman.  \"Impossible!  I am an\n",
        "old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.\n",
        "Rochester at Thornfield Hall.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under\n",
        "that name.\"  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he\n",
        "formed his resolve, and announced it--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.\n",
        "Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the\n",
        "clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.\"  The man\n",
        "obeyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: \"Bigamy is an ugly\n",
        "word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred\n",
        "me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better\n",
        "than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,\n",
        "deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless\n",
        "fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this\n",
        "lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to\n",
        "whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at\n",
        "the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined\n",
        "your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch\n",
        "and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:\n",
        "some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I\n",
        "married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute\n",
        "personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing\n",
        "you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd\n",
        "almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came\n",
        "of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her\n",
        "mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out\n",
        "after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets\n",
        "before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.\n",
        "I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy\n",
        "man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,\n",
        "if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,\n",
        "Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.\n",
        "Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was\n",
        "cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break\n",
        "the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This\n",
        "girl,\" he continued, looking at me, \"knew no more than you, Wood, of the\n",
        "disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt\n",
        "she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded\n",
        "wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of\n",
        "you--follow!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came\n",
        "after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Take it back to the coach-house, John,\" said Mr. Rochester coolly; \"it\n",
        "will not be wanted to-day.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and\n",

        "\"To the right-about--every soul!\" cried the master; \"away with your\n",

        "late!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still\n",
        "beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the\n",
        "first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:\n",
        "the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to\n",
        "the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You know this place, Mason,\" said our guide; \"she bit and stabbed you\n",

        "\n",
        "He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,\n",
        "too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded\n",
        "by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a\n",
        "chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a\n",
        "saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure\n",
        "ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,\n",
        "one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all\n",
        "fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was\n",
        "covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a\n",

        "your charge to-day?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you,\" replied Grace, lifting the boiling\n",

        "\n",
        "A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed\n",

        "\"Ah! sir, she sees you!\" exclaimed Grace: \"you'd better not stay.\"\n",

        "\"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and\n",
        "gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those\n",
        "bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Keep out of the way,\" said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: \"she has\n",
        "no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in\n",
        "mortal discretion to fathom her craft.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We had better leave her,\" whispered Mason.\n",

        "\"Go to the devil!\" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"'Ware!\" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.\n",
        "Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat\n",
        "viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a\n",
        "big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent\n",
        "besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she\n",
        "almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with\n",
        "a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At\n",
        "last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned\n",
        "them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a\n",
        "chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the\n",
        "most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he\n",
        "looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That is _my wife_,\" said he.  \"Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am\n",
        "ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure\n",
        "hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have\" (laying his hand on my\n",
        "shoulder): \"this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth\n",
        "of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just\n",
        "as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the\n",
        "difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this\n",
        "face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of\n",
        "the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge\n",
        "ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some\n",
        "further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended\n",

        "the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who\n",
        "was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,\n",
        "happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he\n",
        "knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of\n",
        "Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,\n",
        "revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is\n",
        "now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his\n",
        "disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will\n",
        "ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you\n",
        "from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to\n",
        "lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred\n",
        "him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not\n",
        "too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain\n",
        "that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to\n",

        "anything else to stay for?\" he inquired of Mr. Mason.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No, no--let us be gone,\" was the anxious reply; and without waiting to\n",
        "take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The\n",
        "clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or\n",
        "reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.\n",

        "bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I\n",
        "was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding\n",
        "dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I\n",
        "thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I\n",
        "leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I\n",
        "thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down\n",

        "living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:\n",

        "\n",
        "Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a\n",

        "desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December\n",
        "storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed\n",

        "which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with\n",
        "untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and\n",
        "flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and\n",
        "white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck\n",
        "with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in\n",
        "the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so\n",
        "blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could\n",
        "never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my\n",
        "master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering\n",
        "child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not\n",
        "seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.\n",
        "Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence\n",
        "destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not\n",
        "what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say\n",
        "he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from\n",
        "his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.\n",
        "When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted\n",
        "not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could\n",
        "not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he\n",
        "would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view\n",
        "must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my\n",

        "\n",
        "My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round\n",
        "me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,\n",
        "relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up\n",
        "bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and\n",
        "felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.\n",
        "I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like\n",
        "within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these\n",
        "words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that\n",
        "should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--\n",

        "consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith\n",
        "death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That\n",

        "the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,\n",
        "\"What am I to do?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "But the answer my mind gave--\"Leave Thornfield at once\"--was so prompt,\n",

        "now.  \"That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my\n",
        "woe,\" I alleged: \"that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and\n",

        "\n",
        "But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that\n",

        "that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out\n",
        "for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told\n",
        "her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and\n",
        "swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded\n",
        "depths of agony.\n",

        "\n",
        "I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a\n",
        "judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head\n",
        "swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement\n",
        "and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I\n",
        "had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,\n",
        "long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I\n",
        "was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at\n",
        "the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  \"Friends always forget\n",

        "out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was\n",
        "dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,\n",
        "but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I\n",

        "minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock\n",
        "like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!\n",
        "I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are\n",
        "passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot\n",
        "rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a\n",

        "hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer\n",
        "in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk\n",

        "\n",

        "top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and\n",
        "brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach\n",
        "the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it\n",
        "possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?\n",
        "Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman\n",
        "opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless\n",

        "well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I\n",

        "but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,\n",
        "where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could\n",

        "the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  \"That is an _ignis\n",
        "fatuus_,\" was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It\n",
        "burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  \"Is\n",

        "enlarge.  \"It may be a candle in a house,\" I then conjectured; \"but if\n",
        "so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a\n",

        "\n",

        "tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It\n",
        "led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been\n",
        "impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height\n",
        "of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my\n",
        "faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I\n",
        "approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,\n",
        "which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,\n",
        "apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms\n",
        "and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some\n",
        "obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the\n",
        "dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above\n",
        "it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I\n",
        "groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a\n",
        "wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a\n",
        "sable bush-holly or yew.\n",
        "\n",
        "Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose\n",
        "to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone\n",
        "nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared\n",
        "it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out\n",
        "the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small\n",
        "latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the\n",
        "growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick\n",
        "over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was\n",
        "so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed\n",
        "unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage\n",
        "shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room\n",
        "with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter\n",
        "plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing\n",
        "peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The\n",
        "candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its\n",
        "light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,\n",
        "like all about her, was knitting a stocking.\n",
        "\n",
        "I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing\n",
        "extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,\n",
        "sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,\n",
        "graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,\n",
        "the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and\n",
        "bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and\n",
        "faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one\n",
        "girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.\n",
        "\n",
        "A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were\n",
        "they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the\n",
        "table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and\n",
        "cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I\n",
        "gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call\n",
        "them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each\n",
        "bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand\n",
        "between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which\n",
        "they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller\n",
        "books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to\n",
        "aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all\n",
        "the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so\n",
        "hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock\n",
        "tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the\n",
        "click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice\n",
        "broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Listen, Diana,\" said one of the absorbed students; \"Franz and old Daniel\n",
        "are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which\n",
        "he has awakened in terror--listen!\"  And in a low voice she read\n",
        "something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an\n",
        "unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or\n",
        "German I could not tell.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"That is strong,\" she said, when she had finished: \"I relish it.\"  The\n",
        "other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,\n",
        "while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later\n",
        "day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the\n",
        "line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on\n",
        "sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--\n",
        "\n",
        "\"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!\"\n",
        "she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  \"There you have a\n",
        "dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a\n",
        "hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines\n",
        "Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Both were again silent.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we\n",

        "\n",
        "\"And what good does it do you?\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:\n",
        "soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ah, childer!\" said she, \"it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:\n",

        "laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the\n",
        "next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver\n",
        "wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and\n",

        "\n",
        "I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for\n",
        "such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair\n",
        "complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction\n",
        "and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the\n",
        "other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's\n",
        "pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses\n",

        "There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when\n",

        "presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and\n",
        "brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five\n",
        "minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;\n",

        "more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of\n",

        "in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no\n",
        "place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never\n",

        "for being united.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two\n",

        "\n",
        "They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by\n",
        "the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed\n",
        "through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly\n",
        "expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to\n",
        "come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You should have waited for my leave to descend,\" she said.  \"You still\n",

        "\n",
        "Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She\n",
        "possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face\n",
        "seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally\n",
        "intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more\n",
        "reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and\n",
        "spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my\n",
        "nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,\n",
        "and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active\n",
        "will.\n",
        "\n",

        "\"Besides, the fire is too hot for you,\" interposed Mary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"To be sure,\" added her sister.  \"Come, you must be obedient.\"  And still\n",
        "holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Sit there,\" she said, placing me on the sofa, \"while we take our things\n",
        "off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our\n",
        "little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,\n",
        "or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat\n",
        "opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the\n",
        "parlour, and then its occupant.\n",
        "\n",
        "The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet\n",
        "comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very\n",
        "bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few\n",
        "strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated\n",
        "the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and\n",
        "an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the\n",
        "room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a\n",
        "lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:\n",
        "everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn\n",
        "and well saved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,\n",
        "keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely\n",
        "sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a\n",
        "man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-\n",
        "eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a\n",
        "Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite\n",
        "an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes\n",
        "so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked\n",
        "at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His\n",
        "eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,\n",
        "colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of\n",
        "fair hair.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it\n",
        "describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,\n",
        "an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,\n",
        "there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my\n",
        "perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or\n",
        "eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one\n",
        "glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in\n",
        "the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top\n",
        "of the oven.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Eat that now,\" she said: \"you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had\n",
        "nothing but some gruel since breakfast.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers\n",
        "now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed\n",
        "his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious\n",
        "directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which\n",
        "told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted\n",
        "from the stranger.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You are very hungry,\" he said.\n",
        "\n",

        "meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the\n",
        "last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings\n",
        "of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not\n",
        "immoderately.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,\" was my very clumsily-\n",
        "contrived, unpolished answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No,\" he said coolly: \"when you have indicated to us the residence of\n",

        "\n",
        "\"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being\n",
        "absolutely without home and friends.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no\n",
        "suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak\n",
        "particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough\n",
        "in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He\n",
        "seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's\n",
        "thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of\n",
        "keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than\n",
        "to encourage.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Do you mean to say,\" he asked, \"that you are completely isolated from\n",

        "\n",
        "\"A most singular position at your age!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the\n",
        "table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon\n",
        "explained the quest.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Diana laughed.  \"Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,\n",

        "\"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating\n",
        "recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw\n",
        "the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning\n",
        "their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and\n",

        "out tears as well as colour.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Where did you last reside?\" he now asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You are too inquisitive, St. John,\" murmured Mary in a low voice; but he\n",
        "leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and\n",
        "piercing look.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my\n",

        "me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives\n",
        "you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,\n",
        "on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer\n",
        "you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of\n",

        "leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot\n",
        "and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound\n",
        "incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as\n",
        "any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the\n",
        "catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a\n",
        "strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my\n",
        "departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me\n",
        "everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and\n",
        "trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to\n",
        "Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I\n",
        "slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without\n",
        "crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;\n",
        "and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the\n",
        "last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your\n",
        "door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your\n",
        "sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my\n",

        "\n",

        "pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound\n",
        "between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little\n",

        "by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow\n",

        "instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited\n",
        "me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest\n",
        "kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and\n",
        "colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this\n",
        "one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and\n",
        "watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,\n",
        "intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually\n",
        "entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.\n",
        "\n",
        "As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly\n",
        "between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the\n",
        "distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at\n",
        "home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the\n",
        "sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.\n",
        "\n",
        "No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or\n",
        "fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,\n",
        "and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission\n",
        "of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.\n",
        "Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would\n",
        "expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than\n",

        "\n",
        "Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some\n",
        "minutes of apparently mournful meditation.\n",
        "\n",
        "But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to\n",
        "friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of\n",
        "a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his\n",
        "life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,\n",
        "that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere\n",
        "Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he\n",
        "sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading\n",
        "or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know\n",
        "not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might\n",
        "be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.\n",
        "\n",
        "I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it\n",
        "was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a\n",
        "strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection\n",
        "for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more\n",
        "of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was\n",
        "manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their\n",
        "soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful\n",
        "delights they could yield.\n",
        "\n",
        "Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity\n",
        "of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him\n",
        "preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:\n",
        "but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it\n",
        "produced on me.\n",
        "\n",
        "It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it\n",
        "was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal\n",
        "breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.\n",
        "This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was\n",
        "thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were\n",
        "softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of\n",
        "consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic\n",
        "doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each\n",
        "reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.\n",
        "When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by\n",
        "his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to\n",
        "me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which\n",
        "I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of\n",
        "disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and\n",
        "disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,\n",
        "conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God\n",
        "which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than\n",
        "had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost\n",
        "elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which\n",

        "\n",
        "Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,\n",

        "held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they\n",
        "were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought\n",
        "out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired\n",
        "accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste\n",
        "of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about\n",

        "your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to\n",

        "\n",
        "He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read\n",

        "all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in\n",
        "what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then\n",

        "perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes\n",
        "shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,\n",
        "and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so\n",
        "soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the\n",
        "white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of\n",

        "I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully\n",
        "as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,\n",
        "with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.\n",
        "Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me\n",
        "hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I\n",
        "was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the\n",
        "educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference\n",
        "rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,\n",
        "and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping\n",
        "rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves\n",
        "obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few\n",
        "examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of\n",
        "excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These\n",
        "soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons\n",
        "neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly\n",
        "manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even\n",
        "surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began\n",
        "personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had\n",
        "amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,\n",
        "almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught\n",
        "the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of\n",
        "needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters\n",
        "desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed\n",
        "many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the\n",
        "farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment\n",
        "in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a\n",
        "consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were\n",
        "not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and\n",
        "benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it\n",
        "made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\n",
        "\n",
        "I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I\n",
        "heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly\n",

        "working people, is like \"sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;\" serene\n",
        "inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,\n",
        "my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:\n",
        "and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful\n",
        "existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,\n",
        "an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush\n",
        "into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the\n",
        "ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,\n",
        "charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still\n",
        "again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and\n",
        "then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,\n",
        "touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of\n",
        "passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first\n",
        "force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how\n",
        "situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;\n",
        "and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and\n",
        "heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was\n",
        "punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady\n",
        "duties of the day.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the\n",

        "canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.\n",
        "Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with\n",
        "her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls\n",
        "that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be\n",
        "imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide\n",
        "through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at\n",
        "the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising\n",
        "lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young\n",
        "pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,\n",
        "even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the\n",
        "door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming\n",
        "features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in\n",
        "their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger\n",
        "than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,\n",
        "conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went\n",
        "up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his\n",
        "face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with\n",
        "his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, \"I love\n",
        "you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps\n",
        "me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that\n",
        "heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.\n",
        "It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would\n",
        "soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from\n",
        "his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic\n",
        "and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to\n",
        "follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give\n",
        "one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one\n",
        "hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that\n",
        "he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in\n",

        "Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I\n",
        "had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:\n",
        "she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly\n",
        "selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely\n",
        "spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,\n",
        "when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),\n",
        "but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;\n",
        "ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was\n",
        "very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;\n",
        "but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very\n",
        "different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters\n",
        "of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except\n",
        "that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer\n",

        "acquaintance.\n",
        "\n",
        "She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,\n",
        "only, certainly, she allowed, \"not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a\n",
        "nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.\"  I was, however,\n",
        "good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she\n",

        "One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless\n",
        "yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the\n",
        "table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,\n",
        "a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my\n",
        "drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty\n",
        "little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from\n",
        "nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She\n",

        "\n",
        "\"With pleasure,\" I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the\n",

        "dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament\n",
        "was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the\n",
        "wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew\n",
        "a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,\n",

        "day.\n",
        "\n",
        "She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself\n",

        "grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright\n",
        "flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud\n",
        "personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait\n",
        "pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the\n",
        "land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great\n",
        "respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the\n",
        "ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to\n",
        "them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,\n",
        "if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that\n",
        "so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going\n",
        "out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It\n",
        "appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of\n",
        "Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young\n",

        "helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a\n",
        "penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,\n",
        "polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and\n",

        "\n",
        "The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my\n",
        "palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier\n",
        "occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was\n",
        "finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to\n",
        "shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl\n",
        "here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash\n",
        "under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice\n",
        "details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John\n",

        "golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less\n",

        "know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power\n",
        "over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,\n",
        "their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful\n",
        "angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble\n",
        "ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?\n",
        "No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they\n",

        "themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been\n",
        "lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every\n",
        "ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the\n",

        "orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never\n",
        "forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,\n",
        "to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of\n",
        "her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find\n",
        "her out.  You know the rest.\"  Again he was going, but I set my back\n",
        "against the door.\n",
        "\n",

        "when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine\n",
        "affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the\n",

        "discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the\n",
        "heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,\n",
        "vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and\n",
        "welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped\n",

        "I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the\n",

        "them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere\n",
        "long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending\n",
        "stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my\n",
        "life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.\n",
        "They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could\n",
        "reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be\n",
        "theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally\n",
        "would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would\n",
        "be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:\n",

        "\n",
        "How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot\n",
        "tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,\n",
        "and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me\n",
        "to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and\n",

        "\n",

        "ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and\n",
        "dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked\n",
        "fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished\n",
        "entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the\n",
        "passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought\n",
        "Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it\n",

        "St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the\n",

        "commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed\n",
        "to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the\n",
        "progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,\n",
        "he asked, \"If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?\"  I answered\n",
        "by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of\n",
        "my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the\n",
        "house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered\n",
        "upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of\n",
        "fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so\n",
        "short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the\n",
        "improved aspect of his abode.\n",
        "\n",
        "This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed\n",
        "some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:\n",
        "no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously\n",
        "respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more\n",
        "thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,\n",
        "had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,\n",
        "could I tell him where such a book was?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to\n",
        "his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began\n",
        "to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.\n",
        "The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its\n",
        "peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after\n",
        "what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor\n",
        "approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,\n",
        "still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I\n",
        "comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that\n",
        "it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by\n",
        "inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him\n",
        "that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should\n",
        "despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he\n",
        "should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever\n",
        "conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the\n",
        "material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her\n",
        "lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great\n",
        "interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous\n",

        "\n",
        "\"This parlour is not his sphere,\" I reflected: \"the Himalayan ridge or\n",
        "Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him\n",
        "better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his\n",
        "element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to\n",
        "advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is\n",
        "proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak\n",
        "and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the\n",
        "advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's\n",

        "It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a\n",
        "lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened\n",
        "the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a\n",
        "minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's\n",
        "soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed\n",
        "me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked\n",
        "eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened\n",
        "into the house.\n",
        "\n",
        "They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and\n",
        "chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances\n",
        "expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought\n",
        "in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from\n",
        "the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave\n",
        "each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a\n",
        "while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would\n",
        "soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give\n",
        "hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.\n",
        "They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;\n",
        "with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:\n",
        "they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of\n",
        "feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I\n",
        "had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so\n",
        "eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's\n",
        "taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow\n",
        "of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the\n",
        "day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the\n",
        "accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of\n",
        "reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the\n",
        "very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap\n",
        "was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that \"a poor\n",

        "purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying\n",

        "clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the\n",
        "firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy\n",
        "fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and\n",
        "spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us\n",

        "The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,\n",
        "moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I\n",
        "had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes\n",
        "went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game\n",
        "covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in\n",
        "consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then\n",
        "remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or\n",
        "three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went\n",
        "there in the season to shoot.\n",
        "\n",
        "To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the\n",
        "characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating\n",
        "rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and\n",
        "driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a\n",
        "very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so\n",
        "thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates\n",
        "between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through\n",
        "them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There\n",
        "was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and\n",
        "knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon\n",

        "gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the\n",
        "amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He\n",
