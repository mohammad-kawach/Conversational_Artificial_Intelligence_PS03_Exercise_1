# NLTK Text Analysis Code Documentation

## Code Structure and Documentation

### Library Installation and Imports
```python
# Install and import required libraries
!pip install nltk
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.probability import FreqDist
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### NLTK Data Download
```python
# Download required NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')
```

### Text Sample Definition
```python
# Create sample text
text = """
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
"""
```

### Text Processing
```python
# Tokenize the text
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Create frequency distribution
freq_dist = FreqDist(tokens)

# Print frequencies to verify we have data
print("Top 10 most frequent tokens:")
for word, freq in freq_dist.most_common(10):
    print(f"{word}: {freq}")
```

### Visualization Methods

#### Method 1: NLTK Built-in Plot
```python
# Create and display the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
# Plot the 20 most common tokens
freq_dist.plot(20)  # This is a built-in plotting method from NLTK
plt.title('Frequency Distribution of Tokens')
plt.xlabel('Tokens')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout to prevent label cutoff
plt.show()
```

#### Method 2: Custom Matplotlib Plot
```python
# Alternative plot using matplotlib directly
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
words = [word for word, freq in freq_dist.most_common(20)]
freqs = [freq for word, freq in freq_dist.most_common(20)]
plt.bar(words, freqs)
plt.title('Frequency Distribution of Tokens')
plt.xlabel('Tokens')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Code Explanation

### 1. Setup Phase
- Installs NLTK library using pip
- Imports necessary modules from NLTK and matplotlib
- Downloads required NLTK tokenizer data

### 2. Data Preparation
- Defines sample text (excerpt from literature)
- Text is stored as a multi-line string for processing

### 3. Text Processing
- Tokenizes text into individual words and punctuation
- Creates frequency distribution of tokens
- Prints top 10 most frequent tokens for verification

### 4. Visualization
- Implements two different plotting methods:
  1. NLTK's built-in frequency distribution plot
  2. Custom matplotlib bar plot
- Both plots include:
  - Figure size specification
  - Title and axis labels
  - Rotated x-axis labels
  - Layout adjustment

### 5. Code Style Notes
- Consistent comment formatting
- Clear section separation
- Proper indentation
- Descriptive variable names
